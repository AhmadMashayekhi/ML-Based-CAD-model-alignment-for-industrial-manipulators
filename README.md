# PointNetLK_CAD_PCD_Alignment

This repository contains the full pipeline used for automatic CAD–PCD alignment of industrial robot bases using **PointNetLK** and **ICP refinement**.  
The workflow was implemented and validated as part of the XR-Twin project at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) / Flanders Make.

## Workflow Overview

### 1- Generate Random Meshes Poses
Use `Creating_random_poses.py` to randomly place robot meshes in 3D space; using forward kinematics of the robot. This script creates JSON files containing the randomly generated transformations. 
For this purpose, run:
```bash
python Creating_random_poses.py
```

### 2- Create Synthetic Datasets
Run `Creating_data_sets.py` to build paired datasets of CAD and PCD point clouds. All robot meshes, the CAD model and the ground transformation which relates them are stored in `.hdf5` format. Run:
```bash
python Creating_data_sets.py
```

### 3- Configure and Launch Training
`main_train_code.py` defines the training configuration (epochs, learning rate, etc.).
It uses data prepared in Step 2 and calls the model definition from the Learning3D toolbox.

### 4- Train the PointNetLK Model
Run:
```bash
python Train_PointNetLK.py
```
This script trains the PointNetLK model for rigid point cloud registration.
Checkpoints are saved to:
```
Input_Output/checkpoints/
```

### 5- Evaluate and Visualize Results
Finally, run:
```bash
python Test_PointNetLK_ICP.py
```
This script loads a trained model and performs registration followed by ICP refinement.  
It outputs JSON result files and optional 3D visualizations.
